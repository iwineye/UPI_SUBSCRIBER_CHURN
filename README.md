# UPI_SUBSCRIBER_CHURN.
 
This project deals with a real world problem faced by UPI payment based fintechs companies.

An idea of subscription based ser0vice is already in use for comercial transaaction for traders. 

Problem Statement:

From the above diagram we can understand the communication involved behind every payment.

UPI's have successfully bipassed the banks when it comes to payments in day to day transactions.

The major road block appears to be the shortage of IT infrastructure often on the side Banks and UPI system.

which is controlled by.

Even though the service provider may have the industry level IT infrastructure the efficiency of their service 

equally relies upon the IT infrastructure of other governance bodies such as RBI and UPI and BANK'S 

who are the key players in approval of a digital transaciton and record keeping between payee and reciever.

While banks are being bypassed by the UPI Payment apps there is little to no incentive for the banks to upgrade their IT 

infrastructure to meet the demand of the growing UPI transactions leading to dead lock.

One plausible solution for the UPI companies is to incentivise select banks or group of banks based on their custmoer base.

By investing in the bank's infrastructure with seperate payment lines for their own customers this problem can be dealt to much 

extent.

This can be possible only when they have a subscription based model for its customers with nominal charges in return for a seemless 

transaction expereince. 

It is important to note that a similar practice in the form of taxation is already being immplemented on a commercial level for 

merchants as interchange fee but not yet to normal customers.

Dataset: 

The dataset is hypothetical and is built using parameters that are likely to considered, when and if the service is to be rolled to the 

general public. Parameters include CUSTOMER_ID,	GENDER,	AVG_MONTHLY_TRANSACTIONS,	RESIDENTIAL	,Bank_type	,SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS (CHURN).


Objectives :

1. Using Artificial Neural Network predict who is more likely to opt out in for this service and who is isn't.
